                           pam-krb5 To-Do List

 * Support the remaining PAM options that the Sourceforge module supports.
   The most interesting are banner, keytab, and ticket_lifetime.

 * Currently, the module doesn't provide any useful realm to the Kerberos
   libraries when reading krb5.conf defaults.  It should default the realm
   to the local realm and allow the realm to be overridden via PAM
   configuration.

 * The current build system is only going to work on Linux and requires
   Makefile twiddling to build against Heimdal instead of MIT.  Should use
   Autoconf instead and automatically detect the desired Kerberos library.

 * Try to support Solaris as well.  I don't know how close the module is
   to just working and how much the Solaris PAM setup differs from Linux.
   (HP-UX is probably not worth the effort.)
