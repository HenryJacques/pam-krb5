libpam-krb5 (1.2.0-2)

  The user's credential cache is now created by the session stage of the
  PAM module rather than the authentication stage.  This means that if you
  were setting the ccache option in the PAM configuration, be sure to set
  that option in the configuration line for the session stage as well for
  it to take effect.
