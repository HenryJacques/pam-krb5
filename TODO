                           pam-krb5 To-Do List

 * The PAM option parsing is repetitive code that involves counting the
   lengths of strings.  It should be possible to replace most of it with
   some carefully-chosen macros.

 * Add an option to prompt the user for a Kerberos principal to use for
   authentication.

 * The PKINIT code for Heimdal involves too many #ifdefs right now for my
   taste.  Find a way to restructure it to only wrap the main PKINIT
   function for Heimdal.
