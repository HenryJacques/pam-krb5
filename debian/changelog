libpam-krb5 (1.2.0-1) unstable; urgency=low

  * New upstream maintainer and version.
    - Now supports reinitialization of credentials properly, allowing
      programs such as xlock to refresh credentials.  (Closes: #309345)
      This currently only works with versions of xlock that try to refresh
      credentials (xlockmore does not).
    - Do not include the principal name in the prompt.  This breaks some
      SSH clients and isn't necessary.  (Closes: #321319)
    - New ignore_root option to skip this module for root authentication,
      ameliorating pam_krb5 problems when the network is down.  Partially
      addresses #315622.
  * Bug fixes to upstream version (all sent back to the maintainer):
    - Succeed silently in account management if Kerberos wasn't used.
    - Parse ccache_dir correctly.
    - Bring the man page up to date.
    - Link with -z defs to ensure all symbols were found.
  * Add search_k5login option to allow authentication based on the
    principals listed in ~/.k5login when the local account name doesn't
    easily map to the Kerberos principal.
  * Add a watch file.
  * Update standards version to 3.6.2 (no changes required).
  * Remove maintainer from uploaders; dak can handle this properly.
  * Remove unnecessary code from debian/rules.

libpam-krb5 (1.0-12) unstable; urgency=low

  * Revert the PAM_REINITIALIZE_CREDS change as it breaks sshd with
    UsePAM.  Add a source comment explaining the confusion about the
    meaning of this flag.

 -- Russ Allbery <rra@stanford.edu>  Wed, 13 Apr 2005 16:01:45 -0700

libpam-krb5 (1.0-11) unstable; urgency=low

  * Return PAM_CRED_UNAVAIL to PAM_REINITIALIZE_CREDS as the apparently
    most appropriate error message.  (Closes: #191001)
  * Remove reference to non-existant man page pam.conf(8) and change
    pam(8) to pam(7).  Thanks, Nik A. Melchior.  (Closes: #271066)
  * Include the user UID in the default ticket cache name so that rpc.gssd
    and similar programs can find the ticket cache.  Document the random
    string in the default ticket cache name in the man page.  Thanks,
    Steinar H. Gunderson.  (Closes: #295027)
  * Really remove stray ex.doc-base.package file.

libpam-krb5 (1.0-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Free authentication context used to prevent KDC spoofing, fixing a
    file descriptor leak.  Thanks, Martin KÃ¶gler.  (Closes: #194542)
  * Fix use_first_pass and try_first_pass for password changes and report
    password change errors via the PAM conversation.  Thanks, Martin Mares.
    (Closes: #133461)
  * Return PAM_USER_UNKNOWN and PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL where appropriate
    when authenticating.  Thanks, Roland Bauerschmidt.  (Closes: #239399)
  * Add missing includes to eliminate warnings.
  * Update standards version to 3.6.1.
    - Build with -g -O2 by default and support requesting no optimization.
  * Simplified the build system.  The copy of source files into a
    subdirectory isn't needed since we don't apply patches at build time,
    so the package can be built normally with a regular make invocation.
  * Be sure not to pass -I/usr/include to the compiler.
  * Updated the build system to debhelper 4.
    - Removed unneeded call to dh_suidregister.
    - Use dh_installman rather than dh_installmanpages.
  * Flesh out the package description.
  * Removed stray ex.doc-base.package file.
  * Refer to /usr/share/common-licenses in debian/copyright for the GPL
    and remove dh_make boilerplate language.

  * Upload with no code changes in order to pick up symbol versions,
    Closes: #260372 
  * High urgency because we want this to make it into sarge.
  * Don't build-depend on libdb2-dev, Closes: #248517

libpam-krb5 (1.0-6) unstable; urgency=low

  * New version that supports sessions management.  You may want to use
    this to write out credentials at session managemment time, for example
    so they can be used  by openafs.

 -- Sam Hartman <hartmans@debian.org>  Sat, 12 May 2001 18:41:49 -0400

libpam-krb5 (1.0-5) unstable; urgency=low

  * Fix build-depends, closes: #80555

 -- Sam Hartman <hartmans@debian.org>  Wed, 27 Dec 2000 17:02:18 -0500

libpam-krb5 (1.0-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Wildcard enctype matching so that you don't have to have a des-cbc-md5
    key.  Previously, if you did not have a des-cbc-md5 key, it looks like
    the code might not verify the ticket against the key, treating it as
    if you had no local key and blindly trusted the KDC.  In practice this
    is not an issue with most Kerberos setups.
  * Test against pam service keys like imap rather than just the host
    service key.  We still prefer host to service keys.

 -- Sam Hartman <hartmans@debian.org>  Tue, 19 Dec 2000 17:49:12 -0500

libpam-krb5 (1.0-3) unstable; urgency=low
