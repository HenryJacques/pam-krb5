                           pam-krb5 To-Do List

 * Support the remaining PAM options that the Sourceforge module supports.
   The most interesting are banner, keytab, and ticket_lifetime.

 * Support expose_account in the PAM configuration and, when set, use the
   native Kerberos prompters that give more information about what account
   the user is authenticating to.

 * Diagnose unknown options to the PAM module.  Currently, they're ignored.
