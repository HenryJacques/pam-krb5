                           pam-krb5 To-Do List

 * Support the remaining PAM options that the Sourceforge module supports.
   The most interesting are banner, keytab, and ticket_lifetime.

 * Support expose_account in the PAM configuration and, when set, use the
   native Kerberos prompters that give more information about what account
   the user is authenticating to.

 * Call krb5_aname_to_localname on the provided username (if search_k5login
   is not enabled) and store the result back in PAM_USER.  This lets people
   log in with a full principal name.  It's not clear how useful this is,
   but there's no reason not to support it.

 * Currently, any prompting that goes through the Kerberos prompter
   function doesn't honor PAM_SILENT and may display error messages or
   text strings if the Kerberos libraries think it should.  In order to
   fix this, the prompter function will need to get back more information
   than just the PAM handle so that it knows whether PAM_SILENT was set.
