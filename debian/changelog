libpam-krb5 (1.0-10) unstable; urgency=low

  * Free authentication context used to prevent KDC spoofing, fixing a
    file descriptor leak.  Thanks, Martin Kggggggler.  (Closes: #194542)
  * Fix use_first_pass and try_first_pass for password changes and report
    password change errors via the PAM conversation.  Thanks, Martin Mares.
    (Closes: #133461)
  * Return PAM_USER_UNKNOWN and PAM_AUTHINFO_UNAVAIL where appropriate
    when authenticating.  Thanks, Roland Bauerschmidt.  (Closes: #239399)
  * Add missing includes to eliminate warnings.
  * Update standards version to 3.6.1.
    - Build with -g -O2 by default and support requesting no optimization.
  * Simplified the build system.  The copy of source files into a
    subdirectory isn't needed since we don't apply patches at build time,
    so the package can be built normally with a regular make invocation.
  * Be sure not to pass -I/usr/include to the compiler.
  * Updated the build system to debhelper 4.
    - Removed unneeded call to dh_suidregister.
    - Use dh_installman rather than dh_installmanpages.
  * Flesh out the package description.
  * Removed stray ex.doc-base.package file.
  * Refer to /usr/share/common-licenses in debian/copyright for the GPL
    and remove dh_make boilerplate language.

libpam-krb5 (1.0-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Wildcard enctype matching so that you don't have to have a des-cbc-md5
    key.  Previously, if you did not have a des-cbc-md5 key, it looks like
    the code might not verify the ticket against the key, treating it as
    if you had no local key and blindly trusted the KDC.  In practice this
    is not an issue with most Kerberos setups.
  * Test against pam service keys like imap rather than just the host
    service key.  We still prefer host to service keys.
