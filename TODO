                           pam-krb5 To-Do List

 * Support the remaining PAM options that the Sourceforge module supports.
   The most interesting are banner, keytab, and ticket_lifetime.

 * Currently, the module doesn't provide any useful realm to the Kerberos
   libraries when reading krb5.conf defaults.  It should default the realm
   to the local realm and allow the realm to be overridden via PAM
   configuration.

 * Try to support Solaris as well.  I don't know how close the module is
   to just working and how much the Solaris PAM setup differs from Linux.
   (HP-UX is probably not worth the effort.)
