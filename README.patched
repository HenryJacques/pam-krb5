The original module has been written by Frank Cusack (see README file).

This particular version of the module is heavily based on the FreeBSD
ports version.

It has also been modified by Joel Kociolek <joko@logidee.com> to be usable
with Debian GNU/Linux.

WARNING: for security reasons, you should not use this module for purposes
other than local login (xdm, login, etc.). Don't use it over a network
unless you _really_ know what you are doing.
