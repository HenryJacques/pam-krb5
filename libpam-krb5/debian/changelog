libpam-krb5 (1.0-4) unstable; urgency=medium

  * Wildcard enctype matching so that you don't have to have a des-cbc-md5
    key.  Previously, if you did not have a des-cbc-md5 key, it looks like
    the code might not verify the ticket against the key, treating it as
    if you had no local key and blindly trusted the KDC.  In practice this
    is not an issue with most Kerberos setups.
  * Test against pam service keys like imap rather than just the host
    service key.  We still prefer host to service keys.
